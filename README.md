Python Basics
Before diving into data science and machine learning, it's crucial to have a good grasp of Python basics. You can start with the following resources:

Basic Syntax
Data Types and Variables
Control Flow (if, for, while)
Functions and Modules
File Handling
Refer to the python_basics/ directory for example scripts and notebooks.

Python Libraries for Data Science
NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

Installation: pip install numpy
Getting Started: NumPy Documentation
Check the numpy_tutorial/ directory for practical examples and tutorials.

Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame.

Installation: pip install pandas
Getting Started: Pandas Documentation
Explore the pandas_tutorial/ directory for detailed examples.

Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Installation: pip install matplotlib
Getting Started: Matplotlib Documentation
Find example plots in the matplotlib_tutorial/ directory.

Seaborn
Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Installation: pip install seaborn
Getting Started: Seaborn Documentation
See the seaborn_tutorial/ directory for various visualization examples.

Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

Installation: pip install scikit-learn
Getting Started: Scikit-learn Documentation
Refer to the scikit_learn_tutorial/ directory for machine learning examples and projects.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format. Topics covered include:

Handling Missing Values
Encoding Categorical Data
Feature Scaling
Examples and detailed explanations are available in the data_preprocessing/ directory.

Data Standardization
Standardizing data is essential for many machine learning algorithms. It involves scaling the data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Check out the data_standardization/ directory for more information and examples on how to standardize your data.

Machine Learning Projects
This repository includes several hands-on projects to apply the concepts learned:

Project 1: Regression Analysis

Project 2: Classification Tasks

Project 3: Clustering Analysis

Project 4: Natural Language Processing

Project 5: Deep Learning with Neural Networks
